# shell_scripts
All my shell scripts in one place 

1) Quotes.sh : Displays random quotes as pop up notifications using quote_notifier.py , every t seconds . 


2)heating_problem.sh: This script solves(mostly) the heating problems that I face on my laptop. It removes intel's poweclamp module and calls heating_problem.py which enables intel's pstate .

Note: This script requires root privileges to run .


3)resizeWindow.py : Dynamically resizes window based on currently executed command. Some comands such as 'ls -la' will require some scrolling so the terminal will resize accordingly.

Place this script in /home/$USER/ directory and then on modify .bashrc file as mentioned in resizeWindow.py
